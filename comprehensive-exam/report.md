Comprehensive Exam
==================

The overall aim of the comprehensive exam is to ensure that the
candidate has

1. A broad understanding of main topics of Computer science and

2. Has the necessary depth in the topic of her research together with
   the necessary communication skills and maturity expected from a
   research scholar.

Therefore the comprehensive is divided into two component, the breadth
component which tests the former and the depth component which tests
the later. We describe these in the next two sections.

## Breadth requirement

The goal of this part of the comprehensive is to test the breadth of
the candidates knowledge. However, in the last few decades, computer
science has grown at tremendous pace and the topics that can be
justifiably considered as computer science has grown exponentially.
Understanding the entire set of topics is therefore neither possible
nor desirable. The requirements prescribed here tries to strike a
balance.the

Broadly, a candidate needs to demonstrate her competence in *any
three* of the following areas of computer science:


1. Algorithms and Data Structures
2. Combinatorics, Mathematical Logic, Probability
3. Theory of Computation including Complexity Theory
4. Computer Architecture
5. Operating Systems
6. Database Management Systems
7. Computer Networks
8. Compilers and Language Translators
9. AI and Machine Learning

To demonstrate her competence, the candidate chooses any three of the
above topics and the comprehensive committee evaluates the candidate
by conducting a written exam. The duration of the exam is 1 hours and
30 minutes.  and will be once every *TODO fix the exam cycle*.  The
students *need not* clear all the three requirement in a single
sitting and can stagger it across different semester of her program
provided the time limit for passing comprehensive exams does not
expire.

The examination committee which sets the question paper should make
sure that the difficulty level is reasonable. In particular, the exam
should strive to stick to the original goal of testing the breadth and
should not burden the candidate by asking deep questions in the
topic. To make the experience less stressful sufficient hints may be
given in the question paper.

The above list of topics will be examined periodically and topics
might be added or deleted form it. As a rough guideline for future
committee, topics may be offered based on various courses taught at
the high undergraduate level (300 or higher) or graduate level (600 or
higher) in our department.

The syllabus for the various topics is given in appendix **TODO to be
filed in by the syllabus committee**

TODO notes
:   It was also proposed that the committee formed for each of these
    topics must provide a very specific syllabus to the students in
    order for them to prepare. An open ended syllabus, e.g. whatever
    an undergraduate course on these topics contain, is not preferred
    by the students, and the committee felt that having a very
    specific list of subtopics that the students have to prepare on,
    must be specified. There were some discussions on fixing specific
    books for each, but the committee did not feel the need for
    that. However, committee suggested that some example reference
    books, or even notes of specific courses associated with the
    subject/area could be made available to the students to help them
    prepare for the exams.

### Evaluation.

Depending on the performance of the candidate in the examination, the
examination committee may decide to award the following grades:

Pass
:   The candidate has successfully completed the breadth requirement and
    hence is can move on to the next phase of her comprehensive.

Maybe Pass
:   The performance in the exam alone *does not* demonstrate
	competence. The candidate will be called for an oral exam after
	which the committee might suggest course of action. After the oral
	exam, the committee *should* be better able to judge the candidate
	and can suggest either pass, remedial pass or fail.

Remedial Pass
:   The examination committee feels that the candidate has deficiency in
    the basics. The student is asked to take a suitable undergraduate
    course in the topic, and receive a B or better grade.  Once this
    is done, the supervisor or in the case when the supervisor has not
    been selected yet, the departmental comprehensive committee) will
    mark the students record as *pass*.  However, these courses are
    meant to overcome the deficiency of the candidate and as such will
    not count towards her PhD course requirements.

Fail
:   The candidate has failed the breadth requirement.


We now give a list of undergraduate courses which can be used to remedy
deficiency in breadth


| Topics                                            | Remedial Courses |
|:--------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|

| Combinatorics, Mathematical Logic and Probability | CS202 and CS203  |
| Theory of computation and basic Complexity theory | CS340            |
| Computer Architecture                             | CS422            |
| Operating System                                  | CS330            |
| Databases                                         | CS315            |

| AI and Machine Learning                           | CS665            |

### Wavier for breadth requirement.

**TODO:**

Overall summary

1. Give waiver to B.Techs from IIT Kanpur who have done the prescribed
   course already and obtained a B.

2. Some modalities to recognise degrees from other places.

## Depth requirement.

**TODO: rather than depth I guess the idea here is research methodology**

Having demonstrated the breadth of her knowledge in Computer Science,
a candidate needs to prove here depth in the topic that she wishes to
pursue her research in. The goal of this component of the comprehensive
is to test the ability of the candidate to

1. Read and comprehend the literature in her area of interest.

2. Effectively communicate ideas to peers.


The overall procedure is as follows.

Testing presentation skills
:   The candidate is asked to read a few papers in an area other than her
    specific area of research area. She then has to summarise the
    results in an oral presentation in front of the examination
    committee.

Testing communication skills
:   The candidate is *should* also summarise the papers read for the oral
    presentation in a brief writeup.


If the student has already published a peer reviewed paper in a
reputed conference or a journal, and her adviser states that the
student mostly did the writing, then the written part of the depth
exam may be waived for such students.
